# Cloud service types

## Infrastructure as a Service

In Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model cloud provider is responsible to manage hardware, network connectivity and physical security of a service. Operating system, storage, database should be maintaned by customer. Simply we are renting hardware from cloud provider.

## Platform as a Service

In Platform as a Service (PaaS) model in addition to IaaS cloud provider is responsible for operating systems, middleware, development tools. Customer does not worry on licensing OS or DBs.

## Software as a Service

Software as a Service (SaaS) model is renting whole deployed software, for example Gmail. We don't have to worry on hardware, network or operating system. Because everything will be managed and maintained by Google.
