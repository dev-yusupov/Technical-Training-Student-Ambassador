# Describe benefits of high availablity and scalibility of cloud

## Service-level agreement

Service-level agreement(SLA) is type of agreement between cloud provider and customer related to quality, availablity of a service. Azure is high-level environment with uptime guarantees. It is difficult to provide 100% uptime. Because services requires upgrades and maintenance. Depending on service type Azure provides 99% and 99.9% uptime availablity. We can ask is there difference between them. Absolutely, during the week it can take only 43 minutes of downtime in 99.9% while in case of 99% it is unavailable for 1.68 hours a week.

## Scalability

Scaling a service refers to adjusting it based on demand. For example, lets assume we deployed a social media application. Overtime the number of users are growing and performance of system is slowing down. We can upgrade server's RAM, CPU or Disk. This is vertical scaling. Apart from that we have horizontal scaling which refers to creating a new virtual machine or adding more microservices to our application to work with better performance. In cloud we can scale our Virtual Machine from 4GB RAM to 8GB RAM more easilty.

## Reliability

Reliablity refers to the ability of a system to easily recover from failures and continue to function. In Azure we can deploy our software to multiple regions. If any of regions fail to work, software in other region can continue to work.

## Predictability

## Performance

Azure offers load balancing services which can redirect requests to less stressed services which can result to better performance. Apart from that Azure offers autoscaling which helps to scale automatically when demand grows by deploying additional resources. Then scale back when demand drops.

## Cost

Azure offers monitors tools for services through which you can predict cost and adjust services based on rediction.
