# Understand Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a branch of AI which combines Computer Science and Mathematics to make a solution to problems.

## What is Machine Learning or ML

Everyday we generate millions of data in text, image and more through emails, text messages, social media and so on. Machine Learning enables us to find relationship between data to make a prediction.

Let's assume we are given data of a daily sale from a shop. We need to create a model which can predict sale rate of a week or month. Model finds the relationship between products, date, month customer's demographic data and more to predict in the future.

## Machine Learning on Microsoft Azure
