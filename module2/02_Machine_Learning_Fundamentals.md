# Fundamentals of Machine Learning

In general form we can say Machine Learning the interseption of data science and software engineering. The goal of Machine Learning is to use predictive models in software applications and services. To achieve this goal requires the collaboration of **data scientists** and **software engineers**. Data Scientists prepare data to *train* models which will be used to predict new data values.

## Origin of Machine Learning

Machine learning originates from statistics and mathematical modeling of data. The fundamental idea of Machine Learning is to use data from past observations to predict unknown outcomes.

Examples:

1. **Ice cream shop**: An icecream shop can use its historical sales data and weather records to predict how many ice creams they can sell on a certain day.
2. Doctor can use historical data of patients to automate prediction of whether new patient has diabet or not based on his weight, blood glucose level.
